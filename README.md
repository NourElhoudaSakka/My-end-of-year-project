# My-end-of-year-project
This is my end of year project that I worked on during May, 2021.
It is about a predictive maintenance of a hydraulic machine by applying Machine Learning algorithms (Scikit learn from Python).
I found the dataset from kaggle on https://www.kaggle.com/mayank1897/predictive-maintenance-of-hydraulic-system/notebook
